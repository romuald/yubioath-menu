## yubioath-menu

Allow fast selection of a OATH token stored in a YubiKey


Similar to yubioath and yubioath-gui. Displays a single GTK menu when called with stored token.

Selecting a menu item will type the token in the current X11 display using xdotool

Use this script from your favorite X11 binding tool (xbindkeys :p) or window manager
